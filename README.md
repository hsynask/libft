# Libft Project
This project contains a library for the C programming language. The library can be used when there is no access to standard functions and is helpful in understanding the implementation of these functions and learning to use them.

### Usage
To use the library, you must first compile the library files to create a static library by following these steps:

Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the library files are located.
Run the make command.
These steps will create a library file named libft.a. To use this file in your project, follow these steps:

Include the library in your C file: #include "libft.h"
Compile your project and run the resulting file.
